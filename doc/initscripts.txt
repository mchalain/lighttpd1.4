* lighttpd responds to the following signals:

SIGINT  - shut down gracefully  (finish serving existing connections and exit)
SIGTERM - shut down immediately (terminate existing connections and exit)
SIGHUP  - re-open log files     (NOTE: does not reload lighttpd configuration)


* lighttpd graceful restart

The current recommended way to reload lighttpd config is to gracefully stop
and then to restart lighttpd.


* lighttpd initscripts

Depending on the operating system and distribution brand, there are many
ways to set up lighttpd to run as a daemon when the system starts up, and
to send signals to lighttpd for start/stop/restart/etc.

Rather than attempting to maintain scripts for an unknown number of distros,
here are links to a few, which can be used as examples.
